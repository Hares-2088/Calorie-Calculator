      <p>
        Although the form asks for gender (male or female), these calculations are guidelines, not rules.
        We recognize that gender exists on a spectrum, and individuals who don't identify with a standard binary gender may find the calculator confusing.

      <p>
        Instead of fixating on metrics, focus on how your body feels about your current nutrition and set goals that align with your well-being.
        If possible, consult with a registered dietitian. Our calculator is a general tool, while a dietitian can tailor advice to your specific situation and needs (Spindler).

      <p>
        Use this calculator as a tool to understand your current situation, but don't take the numbers as definitive. Evaluate the numbers to see if they align with your personal needs and make adjustments accordingly.
